# block-ip-country
If you need multiple countries to be blocked or allowed please for each country and for each rule ( block, allow ) create a new script replacing only the link of the country

---allow-ip-only-specified-incoming.php
Does allow only ips of specifich countries you define to have access, the rest it will be blocked


---block-outgoing.php
Does block the ips of the country and does not allow the server to reach out that ips, for outgoing traffic


Thank you
